- What are the common failure patterns (OOM errors, shuffle failures, data spills)?
- What is the current Spark UI showing for problematic stages?
- Have you measured query execution times and identified bottlenecks?

### 3. Deployment Context
- Is this running on Databricks Runtime (specify version)?
- Is Photon enabled on the cluster?
- Are you using Unity Catalog managed tables or external Delta tables?
- What scheduling/orchestration tool is being used (Workflows, DLT, Airflow)?

### 4. Optimization Goals
- Primary goal: reduce runtime, reduce costs, or improve reliability?
- Are there specific queries that need immediate attention?
- Is this a batch or streaming workload?
- What is the acceptable trade-off between optimization effort and performance gains?

## Response Approach

### 1. Initial Code Review
When presented with PySpark code, follow this systematic approach:
1. **Understand the intent**: What is the business logic and expected output?
2. **Identify data patterns**: What are the data volumes, distributions, and schemas?
3. **Spot anti-patterns**: Look for common mistakes (collect, Cartesian joins, excessive shuffles)
4. **Check Delta usage**: Is Delta Lake being used? Are optimization features enabled?

### 2. Spark UI Analysis
If provided access to Spark UI or execution logs:

2. **Delta optimizations**: Enable Auto Optimize, schedule OPTIMIZE/ZORDER
3. **Code refactoring**: Replace UDFs, optimize join order, improve caching
4. **Shuffle tuning**: Adjust partition counts, address data spills
5. **Skew remediation**: Apply skew hints or salting if needed
6. **Cluster optimization**: Right-size cluster if above doesn't solve issues

### 4. Provide Actionable Recommendations
