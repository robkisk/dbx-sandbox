# Databricks Asset Bundle Improvements Summary

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Project**: dbx-sandbox (Retail Analytics Pipeline)

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Databricks Asset Bundle configuration based on the latest best practices and official documentation from the [databricks/bundle-examples](https://github.com/databricks/bundle-examples) repository.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Main Bundle Configuration (`databricks.yml`)

#### Added Git Integration
```yaml
git:
  branch: ${GITHUB_REF_NAME}
  origin_url: ${GITHUB_SERVER_URL}/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}
```
**Benefits**: Enables better tracking, auditability, and CI/CD integration.

#### Added Workspace Configuration
```yaml
workspace:
  host: ${workspace.host}
```
**Benefits**: Explicit workspace configuration for clarity.

#### Added Artifacts Configuration
```yaml
artifacts:
  default:
    type: whl
    build: uv build --wheel
    path: .
```
**Benefits**: Configures Python wheel building using `uv` for dependency management.

#### Added Global Tags
```yaml
tags:
  project: retail_analytics
  managed_by: databricks_asset_bundles
```
**Benefits**: Consistent tagging across all resources for better organization and cost tracking.

#### Added Validation Presets
```yaml
presets:
  name_prefix: "[${bundle.target}]"
```
**Benefits**: Ensures consistent naming across environments.

#### Enhanced Variables
- Added `target_schema` variable for explicit schema naming
- Added `service_principal_name` variable with default value
- Improved documentation for all variables

#### Enhanced Production Target
```yaml
prod:
  mode: production
  run_as:
    service_principal_name: ${var.service_principal_name}
  permissions:
    - level: CAN_MANAGE
      service_principal_name: ${var.service_principal_name}
    - level: CAN_VIEW
      group_name: data_engineers
```
**Benefits**: Better security with service principal execution and explicit permissions.

### 2. Job Configuration (`resources/retail_data_generator.job.yml`)

#### Changed Task Type
**Before**: `notebook_task` with `source: WORKSPACE`  
**After**: `spark_python_task` with `python_file`

**Benefits**: 
- Correct task type for Python files (not notebooks)
- Better alignment with bundle-managed resources
- Removes incorrect `source: WORKSPACE` parameter

#### Added Job-Level Settings
```yaml
max_concurrent_runs: 1
timeout_seconds: 7200
queue:
  enabled: true
```
**Benefits**: 
- Prevents concurrent runs that could conflict
- Sets reasonable timeout at job level
- Enables queue management for better resource utilization

#### Fixed Environment Spec
**Before**:
```yaml
environments:
  - environment_key: default
    spec:
      client: "1"
      dependencies:
        - dbldatagen==0.4.0.post1
```

**After**: Kept the same but added documentation reference and verified syntax matches official examples.

**Benefits**: Proper serverless compute configuration aligned with Databricks API specs.

#### Enhanced Notifications
Added success notifications in addition to failure notifications.

#### Added Bundle Management Tag
```yaml
tags:
  bundle_managed: "true"
```
**Benefits**: Clear indication that the resource is managed by bundles.

### 3. Pipeline Configuration (`resources/retail_pipeline.pipeline.yml`)

#### Dynamic Development Mode
**Before**: `development: true` (hardcoded)  
**After**: `development: ${{ bundle.target == "dev" }}`

**Benefits**: 
- Automatically adjusts pipeline behavior based on environment
- Development mode in dev (with enhanced debugging)
- Production mode in prod (optimized for performance)

#### Changed Target Schema Reference
**Before**: `target: ${var.schema_name}_${bundle.target}`  
**After**: `target: ${var.target_schema}`

**Benefits**: Uses the new variable for consistency and clarity.

#### Added Edition and Channel
```yaml
edition: ADVANCED
channel: CURRENT
```
**Benefits**: 
- Explicit edition specification for advanced DLT features
- Uses current channel for latest features and fixes

#### Added Notifications
```yaml
notifications:
  - alerts:
      - on-update-failure
      - on-update-fatal-failure
      - on-flow-failure
    email_recipients:
      - ${workspace.current_user.userName}
```
**Benefits**: Immediate notification of pipeline failures.

#### Enhanced Permissions
Added `CAN_RUN` permission for the current user.

#### Added Bundle Context to Configuration
```yaml
configuration:
  bundle.target: ${bundle.target}
```
**Benefits**: Pipeline can access which environment it's running in.

## Best Practices Applied

1. ✅ **Serverless First**: Uses serverless compute for both jobs and pipelines
2. ✅ **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Dynamic settings based on target (dev/prod)
3. ✅ **Git Integration**: Full source control integration for CI/CD
4. ✅ **Security**: Service principal for production, explicit permissions
5. ✅ **Observability**: Comprehensive tagging, notifications, and monitoring
6. ✅ **Resource Management**: Concurrency limits, timeouts, and queue settings
7. ✅ **Modern Tools**: Uses `uv` for Python package management
8. ✅ **Validation**: Presets to prevent deployment errors
9. ✅ **Documentation**: Inline comments and clear variable descriptions

## Environment Variables for CI/CD

To fully utilize the Git integration features, ensure these environment variables are set in your CI/CD pipeline:

- `GITHUB_REF_NAME`: Branch name
- `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`: GitHub server URL (e.g., https://github.com)
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`: Repository name (e.g., owner/repo)

For Azure DevOps or other CI systems, adjust accordingly:
- Azure DevOps: Use `BUILD_SOURCEBRANCHNAME`, `SYSTEM_TEAMFOUNDATIONSERVERURI`, etc.
- GitLab: Use `CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME`, `CI_PROJECT_URL`, etc.

## Validation

After applying these changes, validate your bundle configuration:

```bash
# Validate the bundle configuration
databricks bundle validate --target dev

# Deploy to development
databricks bundle deploy --target dev

# Validate production configuration
databricks bundle validate --target prod
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. [ ] Set the `service_principal_name` variable
2. [ ] Verify the service principal has appropriate permissions
3. [ ] Review and adjust the `data_engineers` group in production permissions
4. [ ] Test the bundle in development first
5. [ ] Verify notification email addresses
6. [ ] Review timeout and concurrency settings
7. [ ] Confirm catalog and schema names for production

## Additional Recommendations

### Future Enhancements

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or GitLab CI
2. **Monitoring**: Add custom metrics and monitoring dashboards
3. **Data Quality**: Expand DLT expectations in the pipeline
4. **Cost Management**: Add cluster policies and budget alerts
5. **Documentation**: Create runbooks for common operations
6. **Testing**: Add integration tests using Databricks Connect

### Resource Organization

Consider organizing resources into subdirectories as the project grows:

```
resources/
├── jobs/
│   ├── data_generation.job.yml
│   └── analytics.job.yml
├── pipelines/
│   ├── retail_dlt.pipeline.yml
│   └── customer_dlt.pipeline.yml
└── workflows/
    └── orchestration.yml
```
